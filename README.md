# CANN

- In this project, we developed a composite artificial neural network model to predict the shape of given images. The model was trained on a dataset consisting of circles, triangles, squares, and hexagons. We aimed to accurately classify the shapes of the images using both the image data and corresponding input sequences.

- After training the model and evaluating its performance, we made predictions on a set of test images. The model successfully predicted the shapes of most of the images correctly, with the majority of the labels matching the ground truth.
